# PHP
  Write a function that allows a user to insert a new employee into a table called "employees". The table has two columns: "id" is an auto_increment integer primary key and "name" is the name of the employee.  CREATE TABLE employees( id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));  Assume you have a MySQL connection pool created and accessible via mysql.pool.  Write route handler which will add a new employee into the table using a parameter called name. So, when I go to the browser and type http://localhost:8080/?name=Edward (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. , an employee named Edward will be added to the database. There is no need to render any content to the user so you can just end return from the handler without calling render.  Write the code for the route handler to produce the desired output.
